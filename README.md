📝 Project Overview

Unipath Assistant AI is a conversational chatbot designed to streamline the chaotic university admission process. It acts as a digital counselor, helping students discover academic programs, track deadlines, and manage their application milestones through a simple, chat-driven interface.
 
 This tool focuses on Deterministic Intelligence. By using a structured knowledge base instead of unpredictable raw LLM calls, the assistant provides  accurate data regarding GPA requirements, document checklists, and application dates.
